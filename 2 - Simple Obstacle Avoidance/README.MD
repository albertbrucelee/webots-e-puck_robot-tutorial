</p>

This repository contain the simple avoidance algorithm program that implemented on e-puck robot and simulated on webots robot simulator.

The source code is written in C programming language.

How does it work? Please read the tutorial from my Medium [here](https://medium.com/@albert.brucelee/3143c096d285)

The program source code is located in the "source code" folder.

## Don't you know about Webots?

If you don't know about it Webots yet, please read the introduction about Webots that I wrote [here](https://medium.com/@albert.brucelee/introduction-to-webots-robot-simulator-and-e-puck-robot-8a2e2b5d22a9), 
or you can follow the official tutorial [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials).

Don't be afraid, this official tutorial is very clean and easy to understand. And I believe that even if you don't know about it yet, you can learn it easily.
