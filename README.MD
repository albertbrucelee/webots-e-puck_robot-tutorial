Webots is an open source robot simulator that provides a complete development environment to model, program and simulate robots. Thousands of institutions worldwide use it for R&D and teaching. Webots has been codeveloped by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, thoroughly tested, well documented and continuously maintained since 1996. It is the most efficient solution to quickly get professional results. [Reference](https://cyberbotics.com/#webots)

The e-puck robot is a mini mobile robot developed by GCtronic and EPFL. The e-puck robot is designed and has been widely used in research and educational purposes and is easy to use [Reference](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/getfile.py?recid=135236&mode=best).

e-puck has been a very successful robot since 2005. About 3000 units used both in education and research. From January 2018 version 2 is available [Reference](https://www.gctronic.com/e-puck2.php).

The e-puck robot is a non-holonomic wheeled robot. Non-holonomic wheeled robot is a robot that depends on the path it can reach to move and cannot move in all directions [Reference](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0036070), different from the holonomic wheeled robot that can move in all directions [Reference](https://doi.org/10.1177/02783640022067977) without changing its orientation. Therefore, if the e-puck robot wants to move to a different direction, the e-puck robot must rotate its body first to face that location.
